# 📱 Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment

## 🎯 Objective

Mobile development requires more resources than web development. To make it easier and smoother, we are using the **Expo Framework** for building and testing React Native apps. This environment will allow us to:

- Develop cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Test apps easily on our own devices using **Expo Go**.
- Skip heavy emulators and focus on building.

## ✅ Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [x] **Node.js LTS** installed – https://nodejs.org/
- [x] **VS Code** as the code editor – https://code.visualstudio.com/
- [x] A compatible operating system: **macOS**, **Windows**, or **Linux**
- [x] A smartphone (Android or iOS) with **Expo Go** installed

## 📲 Why Use Expo Go?

Mobile development traditionally requires device emulators, which are heavy on system resources and not always reliable. Instead of setting up multiple emulators for various phones (like iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 7, etc.), **Expo Go** offers:

- Real device testing
- Fast refresh and debugging
- Fewer compatibility issues
- Seamless integration with the Expo ecosystem
